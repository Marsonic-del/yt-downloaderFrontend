      "Compression: MP3 uses lossy compression, meaning that some audio data is discarded during the compression process to achieve smaller file sizes. However, the compression is designed to be perceptually transparent, meaning that the human ear generally cannot distinguish the difference between the original audio and the compressed version.",
      
      "Bitrate: MP3 files can be created at different bitrates, which determine the amount of data used to represent the audio. Higher bitrates generally result in better audio quality but also larger file sizes. Common bitrates range from 128 kbps (kilobits per second) to 320 kbps.",

It has been a dominant format for music downloads, streaming, and personal audio playback devices for many years. However, it's worth noting that due to its lossy compression, some audio quality is sacrificed for smaller file sizes compared to lossless audio formats like WAV or FLAC."],
